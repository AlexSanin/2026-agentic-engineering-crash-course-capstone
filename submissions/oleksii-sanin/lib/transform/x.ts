 * ponytail: the ceiling is the grapheme count.

 * characters, and a CJK character counts as 2. A thread that is heavy in URLs or in CJK
 * therefore lands a few characters away from the real limit, in both directions.
 *
 * The upgrade path is the `twitter-text` package, which implements the weighted count.
 * It replaces `graphemes()` at the three call sites below and changes nothing else.
 * The human chose `Intl.Segmenter` on 2026-09-20, because it is native and adds no
 * dependency. Take the upgrade when a user reports a part that X rejects.
