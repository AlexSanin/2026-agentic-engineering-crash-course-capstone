# Project rules — capstone, Oleksii Sanin

Stack: Next.js 16 · TypeScript · pnpm · Vitest. The app is not scaffolded yet.

Trust level 1 ("Assistant"): propose first. Wait for a human decision before you change more
than one file. Wait before you run anything that is not on the allow-list in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Read first

- `docs/capstone-spec.md` — when this project is done. Eight requirements, each with a command.
- `docs/mvp-plan.md` — what the product is, the week-one scope, and the cut list.
- `openspec/changes/<name>/` — the spec for the work in flight. Read `proposal.md`, `specs/` and
  `tasks.md` before you write code for that change.
- `.agent-log/README.md` — how the action log records what you did.

## How a change starts

Spec first, code second. Every significant change is an OpenSpec change.

- Significant = new behaviour, a new surface, a new dependency, a config change, or work that
  touches more than one file. A typo, a comment and a one-line fix go direct.
- The order is `proposal.md`, then `specs/<capability>/spec.md`, then `design.md`, then
  `tasks.md`, then code. `/opsx:new` or `/opsx:propose` writes them. `/opsx:apply` implements
  the tasks.
- A scenario in `specs/` with no test is not done. The spec is the acceptance contract, not a
  description of the code.
- Tick each task in `tasks.md` in the same commit as the work it tracks. A tick with no commit
  behind it is a false record.
- When the code and the spec disagree, edit the spec, and commit that edit on its own. Never leave
  the two disagreeing.
- Run `openspec validate <name> --strict` before the change is archived. There is no
  `openspec verify` command in the CLI (checked against openspec 1.4.1). `/opsx:verify` is a skill,
  and it is the agent-driven check, not a command.
- Each significant change also adds a row to `docs/autonomy-log.md`, as it happens.

## Commands (pnpm only — never npm or yarn)

- `pnpm check` — typecheck + lint + tests. Run it before you say a task is done. Quote the output.
- `pnpm dev` — dev server on http://localhost:3000. Never start a second one.
- `pnpm hooks:selftest` — proves the hooks work, without an agent.
- `pnpm agent:log` — summary of `.agent-log/actions.jsonl`: what you actually did this session.

## Definition of done

- `pnpm check` is green. New behaviour has a test beside the code (`*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`).
- Evidence, not claims. Report the command you ran and its exit code or test count.
- The `reviewer` subagent read the diff. Record what it found, even when it found nothing.

## Next.js 16 rules that differ from older versions

- `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()` and `headers()` are async. Always `await` them.
- Request interception is `proxy.ts`, which exports `proxy`. It is not `middleware.ts`.
- Caching is opt-in (`cacheComponents`, `'use cache'`). Do not enable it without a decision from me.
- Server Components are the default. Use `'use client'` for hooks, browser APIs and event handlers only.
- When you are unsure about an API, read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` first. Do not guess.

## Conventions the linter does not enforce

- Pure logic lives in `lib/`, with no React import and no Next import. A Vitest test sits beside it.
- Route handlers in `app/api/**/route.ts` stay thin. They call `lib/`.
- Import alias `@/*` is this directory. Code, comments and commit messages are in English.
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). One logical change per commit.

## Boundaries

- Ask before: you add a dependency, or you edit `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`,
  `eslint.config.mjs`, `.claude/settings.json` or CI.
- Never: touch `.env*` (a hook blocks it anyway). Never delete a test to get green.
  Never disable a lint rule to get green. Never run `git push --force` or `rm -rf`.
- Never edit `.agent-log/` or `.claude/hooks/`. They record what you did. You do not write your own record.

## Claude Code

- Start in plan mode for anything that touches `app/api/**` or a config file. A one-line diff needs no plan.
- The `reviewer` subagent in `.claude/agents/` is the checker. The session that wrote the code never reviews it.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
