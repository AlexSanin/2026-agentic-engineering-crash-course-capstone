## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: One source, four outputs

The transform SHALL accept one markdown string and return four outputs in one call: `blog`, `email`,
`x`, and `linkedin`. The transform SHALL be a pure function. It MUST NOT import React and it MUST NOT
import Next.

#### Scenario: All four outputs come back together
- **WHEN** the caller passes a markdown string with a heading, a paragraph and a link
- **THEN** the result holds a non-empty value for `blog`, `email`, `x` and `linkedin`

#### Scenario: The same input gives the same output
- **WHEN** the caller runs the transform twice on the same string
- **THEN** both results are equal

#### Scenario: Empty input does not throw
- **WHEN** the caller passes an empty string
- **THEN** the result holds an empty value for each of the four outputs, and no error is thrown

### Requirement: Blog output keeps the document structure

The `blog` output SHALL be HTML. Headings, fenced code blocks, lists and links MUST survive the
transform with their structure intact.

#### Scenario: A fenced code block stays a code block
- **WHEN** the source holds a fence marked `ts` with two lines of code
- **THEN** `blog` holds one `<pre><code class="language-ts">` element with both lines inside it

#### Scenario: A link keeps its target
- **WHEN** the source holds `[docs](https://example.com/a?b=1)`
- **THEN** `blog` holds an `<a>` element whose `href` is exactly `https://example.com/a?b=1`

### Requirement: Email output carries inline styles

The `email` output SHALL be HTML with style attributes on the elements. It MUST NOT rely on a
`<style>` block or on an external stylesheet, because Gmail strips both.

#### Scenario: A heading carries a style attribute
- **WHEN** the source holds an `h2` heading
- **THEN** `email` holds an `<h2>` element with a `style` attribute

#### Scenario: A code block stays readable
- **WHEN** the source holds a fenced code block
- **THEN** `email` holds that block with a monospace `font-family` in its `style` attribute

### Requirement: The X thread splits at sentence boundaries

The `x` output SHALL be an array of parts. Each part MUST hold 280 graphemes or fewer, counted with
`Intl.Segmenter`. A split MUST fall on a sentence boundary. A split MUST NOT fall inside a word. Each
part SHALL carry a `n/total` counter.

The grapheme count is a known ceiling. X applies its own weighted count, so a part with many URLs or
CJK characters may land a few characters off.

#### Scenario: Short input gives one part
- **WHEN** the source holds one sentence of 100 characters
- **THEN** `x` holds exactly one part, and that part carries the counter `1/1`

#### Scenario: Long input splits on sentences
- **WHEN** the source holds six sentences of 100 characters each
- **THEN** every part is 280 graphemes or fewer, and every part ends at a sentence boundary

#### Scenario: A sentence longer than the limit splits at a word boundary
- **WHEN** the source holds one sentence of 400 characters with no internal full stop
- **THEN** the parts split at a space, and no part cuts a word in half

#### Scenario: An emoji does not break the count
- **WHEN** the source holds a sentence that ends with a family emoji
- **THEN** the emoji stays whole in one part, and the part holds 280 graphemes or fewer

#### Scenario: A fenced code block stays in its own part
- **WHEN** the source holds a paragraph and then a fenced code block of 5 lines
- **THEN** the code block occupies its own part, and the paragraph occupies another

### Requirement: LinkedIn output is plain text

The `linkedin` output SHALL be plain text. Emphasis marks and heading marks MUST be removed. Each URL
MUST sit on its own line, because LinkedIn breaks an inline link. The output MUST hold 3000 characters
or fewer.

#### Scenario: Emphasis marks are removed
- **WHEN** the source holds `**bold**` and `_italic_`
- **THEN** `linkedin` holds `bold` and `italic` with no asterisk and no underscore

#### Scenario: A link moves to its own line
- **WHEN** the source holds a paragraph with an inline link
- **THEN** `linkedin` holds the link text in the paragraph, and the URL on the next line

#### Scenario: Long input is cut at a sentence
- **WHEN** the source produces more than 3000 characters of plain text
- **THEN** `linkedin` ends at the last complete sentence under 3000 characters
- **AND** the result marks the output as truncated

### Requirement: The result reports its own size

The transform SHALL return a `meta` object beside the four outputs. `meta` MUST hold the X thread part
count, and the character count of each output.

#### Scenario: Meta counts the thread parts
- **WHEN** the transform returns three X parts
- **THEN** `meta.x.parts` is 3

#### Scenario: Meta counts the characters
- **WHEN** the transform returns a LinkedIn output of 1200 characters
- **THEN** `meta.linkedin.chars` is 1200
